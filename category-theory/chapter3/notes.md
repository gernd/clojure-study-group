# Category of no objects
* has zero objects -> zero morphisms
* important when we get to know the category of all categories

# Simple graphs
* you can build categories by just connecting objects with arrows
* you can start with any directed graph and can make it into a category by simply 
  adding more arrows
  * first: identity arrow
  * then: one arrow for any two composable arrows
  * you usually end up with infinite arrows
* such a category is called a free category generated by a given graph
* example of free construction: process of completing a given structure with a minimum number of items to satisfy its laws

# Orders
* category where a morphism is a relation between objects: relation of being less than or equal
* identitiy morphism: every element is less than equal to itself
* composition if a <=b and b <= c then a <= c
* composition is associative
* a set with a relation like this is called a preorder -> preorder is a category
* needed for an partial order, an additional constraint has to be fullfilled:
a <= b and b <= a then a = b
* if any two objects in the category are in relation with each other: total (linear) order
## Characterization of ordered sets as categories
  * preorder: category where there is at most one morphism going from any object a to any object (thin category)
 * also see  [question on math stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2840312/how-is-a-preorder-a-thin-category)
  * A set of morphisms from object a to object b in category C is called a hom-set, written as C(a,b)
  * every hom-set in a preorder is either empty or a singleton
    * includes the hom-set C(a,a) containing identity
    * you can have cycles in a preorder
    * cycles are forbidden in a partial order
* it is very important to be able to recognize preorders, partial orders and total orders because of sorting
* sorting algorithms can only work correctly on total orders
* partial orders can be soorted using topological sort
## Monoid as Set
* e.g. Multiplication and Addition form a monoid
* defined as a set with a binary operation
* requirements on the operation
  * associative
  * there is a special element that behaves like a unit (neutral element)
* Neutral Element for addition: 0 (for multiplication: 1)
* another example: string concatenation (neutral element: empty string)

## Monoid as Category
* example for binary function: adders (e.g a function that adds 5)
* how do adders compose: following the rules of addition (+3 +5 -> new adder that adds 8)
* identitiy function: adder that adds 0
* a monoid is a single object category (can be described as a single object
category with a set of morphisms that follow rules of composition)
* we can always extract a set of morphmisms from a categorical monoid (e.g. for an Object o hom(o,o))
* in our example, this would be the adders
* we can then define a binary relation for these homomorphisms (monodial product = composition of morphisms)
  * composition of two morphisms always exists, because source and target are equal for both morphisms
  * it is associative, because it is a category
  * identity element = neutral element
  * -> we can always recover a set monoid from a categorical monoid
